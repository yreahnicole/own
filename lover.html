		<p align="center"> This is my boyfriend. His name is Alec Aljon Villanueva lives in Meycauayan Bulacan. He is  very sweet, caring, understanding, 
		clingy, and kind. This human inspires me to study hard , so that no one can underestimate me. He is also my human diary. I always tell him if 
		something happen that made me upset me, or happy. We are in a long distance relationship for me because he is from Region 3 and I am from Region 4a. But 
		even though our status is like that, that is not a hindrance to express our feelings for each other.(P.S. too sweet and gave me some goosebumps while typing this description)
